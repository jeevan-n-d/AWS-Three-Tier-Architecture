# AWS-Three-Tier-Architecture
Three-Tier Architecture Deployment on AWS

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Three-Tier Architecture (Presentation, Application, Database) on AWS Cloud using core services like EC2, RDS, ALB, and ACM. The setup ensures high availability, scalability, and secure communication between tiers.

📌 Architecture Overview

Presentation Tier (Web): EC2 instances hosting the frontend/web application.

Application Tier (Logic): EC2 instances for backend processing and APIs.

Database Tier: Amazon RDS for secure and managed database storage.

Load Balancing & Security: Application Load Balancer (ALB) with ACM for SSL certificates.

⚙️ Services Used

Amazon EC2 – Compute layer for hosting web and app tiers.

Amazon RDS – Relational database service for the data layer.

Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Distributes traffic between tiers.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) – Provides SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.

🚀 Deployment Steps

Launch EC2 instances for web and app layers.

Configure an RDS instance for the database tier.

Set up Application Load Balancer to manage traffic.

Use ACM to enable secure HTTPS communication.

Connect tiers for seamless communication.

📊 Key Benefits

High availability & fault tolerance.

Secure communication with SSL/TLS.

Scalable architecture supporting multiple instances.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add Auto Scaling Groups for dynamic scaling.

Integrate CloudWatch monitoring for performance metrics.

Implement CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.
